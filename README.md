# styled-compliments

Silly little package inspired by the talk "Styled Components, SSR and Themint" by [Kasia JastrzÄ™bska](https://github.com/kajas90) at [React Finland 2018](https://react-finland.fi/)

> I have this thing where I accidentally pronounce `styled-components` as `styled-compliments`. Count them and I will drink as many shots at the afterparty
