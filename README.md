# styled-compliments

`styled-compliments` provides you with a `styled-components`-compatible compliment component!

This is a silly little package inspired by the talk "Styled Components, SSR and Theming" by [Kasia JastrzÄ™bska](https://github.com/kajas90) at [React Finland 2018](https://react-finland.fi/)

> I have this thing where I accidentally pronounce `styled-components` as `styled-compliments`. Count them and I will drink as many shots at the afterparty

## Contributing / TODO

* [ ] enforce `prettier`
* [x] store compliments in a separate file, fetch a random one
* [ ] write lots of compliments
* [ ] translations?
